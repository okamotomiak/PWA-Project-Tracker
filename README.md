# PWA-Project-Tracker

This repository contains Google Apps Script code for managing project and task tracking within Google Sheets.

## Scripts

- **recreateProjectTrackingSheet** – creates or refreshes a "Project Tracking" sheet in the active spreadsheet with sample data.
- **createRecurringTasksSheet** – creates or refreshes a "Recurring Tasks" sheet for scheduling repeating tasks in the active spreadsheet.

Each script formats the sheet with headers, example rows, and color-coded statuses without generating a separate file.
