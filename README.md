# PWA-Project-Tracker

This repository contains Google Apps Script code for managing project and task tracking within Google Sheets.

## Scripts

- **recreateProjectTrackingSheet** – generates a "Project Tracking" spreadsheet with sample data.
- **createRecurringTasksSheet** – generates a "Recurring Tasks" spreadsheet for scheduling tasks that repeat on a weekly or monthly basis.

Each script creates a new spreadsheet and formats the sheet with headers, example rows, and color-coded statuses.
